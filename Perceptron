An end-to-end machine learning pipeline using a perceptron model
Particulas:
1. Load dataset using Pandas
2. Split the dataset into training and test sets using Scikit-Learn
3. Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including a perceptron model
4. Optimize the pipeline by validating the design decisions
5. Test the best pipeline on the test set and report various evaluation metrics
